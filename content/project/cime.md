CIME is a company specialized in training courses for employees of other companies to help them acquire new skills or sharpen them.

The goal was to create a fresh and welcoming experience.
This website was both intended as a corporate website, and to work as an online "shop" for courses. This caused the navigation and the sheer amount of templates to be really high. Hi fidelity designs were required for all the templates, so the project took quite some time.

The integration and development part was handled by another agency.
