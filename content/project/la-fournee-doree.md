Full development for the new website of La Fournée Dorée, a french brand of yummy pastries.

The design was made by the _Paris Heure Locale_ agency. I helped them build the specifications part, and handled the whole development process, from JPG templates to the launch.
The whole project was really full of exchanges between the designer and I, mostly to find optimal solutions to navigation/UI/UX problems.

The back-end is simply WordPress, for ease-of-use since the client knew it.
