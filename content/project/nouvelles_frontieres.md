Based on the layout which won the competition, made by the agency, I made all modifications and sub-pages for the then-new site of Nouvelles Frontières. Made while I was working at _Havas WorldWide Paris_.

Creation of various page templates, most notably product pages, funnel, etc.

These designs were then sent to the client, who handled integration and development on their side.
