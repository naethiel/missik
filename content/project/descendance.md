Game-design and art direction for a multi-player browser and mobile online game in which players compete for the control of their city.

Background is inspired by Aarklash, from Rackham.

UI design, print design for a beautiful book containing background about the game, mostly who are the 3 main factions and why they are at war.

The UI on mobile includes an Augmented Reality part where the player can use his camera to collect resources around him in the city while he wanders around or fight other players he passes by.
