_Paris Heure Locale_ called me to help them rework their website. They had an idea of what they wanted, but were not at ease with the various technical specificities of designing for the web at that time. I helped them create a design that retained their ideas while being technically viable.

I then handled the front-end development part. The back-end, server stuff and release was in the hands of a back-end developper.
