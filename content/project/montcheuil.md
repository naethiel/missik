The "Fondation de Montcheuil", a nonprofit organization, France, asked us to redesign their website, following the total rework of their logo and brand. The main focus point was to handle the "support us" sections properly, to be as clear as possible while presenting the various options offered to benefactors.

Since most of their target audience is rather old, the website focuses on high-contrast, large interaction elements and provides a manual zoom-in option to scale the website up in case the user needs it.
