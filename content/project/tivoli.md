Saint-Joseph de Tivoli, a private school in Bordeaux, France, needed a brand new website. We delivered with a homepage really focused on presenting the school to prospects, while keeping the inner pages full of content and useful informations for students and parents alike. A fully-responsive website with rich visuals and strong branding was the answer we delivered.

The two separate navigation elements, separating primary pages and keeping them easily accessible, allowed us to have the numerous sub-pages Tivoli wanted while keeping the design clean.
