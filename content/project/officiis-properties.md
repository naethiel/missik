In 2016, Officiis Properties (formerly Zublin Immobilier), a french real estate company, asked us to create their new website and brand, accompanying their brand name change. Timing was crucial, as the new website would be launched just after the name change announcement. The main difficulty being that we had to create a whole new art direction for a brand which name was still to be determined.

Made while I was working at _SEITOSEI_, this project involved the art direction, creation of the various page templates, integration and front-end development in collaboration with the development team, who handled the back-end side.
